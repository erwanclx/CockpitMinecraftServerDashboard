This is an extension of embarqued Linux Cockpit to manage Minecraft Server with RCON, logs, player list, etc.
It is compose by two parts:
- A Cockpit plugin to manage the server

```

## Cockpit Plugin

Then, you need to install the Cockpit plugin on the server where the Cockpit is installed.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:erwanclx/CockpitMinecraftServerDashboard.git
cd CockpitMinecraftServerDashboard

mkdir -p ~/.local/share/cockpit
ln -s `pwd`/dist ~/.local/share/cockpit/minecraft-server-dashboard
